      <description>A while ago I built a smart mirror to help keep track of the time and appointments throughout the day. It currently sits on my desk but will eventually be moved to the bathroom.
It recently stopped working so I decided to use this opportunity to document it properly and record the workarounds to all the &amp;ldquo;little nigglies&amp;rdquo; that came up in the course of the project.
Basic design The mirror is simply an LCD screen behind a pane of one way glass.</description>

      <description>I have a set of old very worse-for-wear speakers from when my dad was my age. They are quite old, the cabinets have peeling chipboard, and one of the front panels was falling off. Their Spouse Approval Factor was rock bottom. Nevertheless they still sounded pretty good.
I finally decided to open them up, remove the drivers and build new cabinets for them if they were worth saving.</description>

      <description>What is going on here? Welcome. You have stumbled upon my project log. This is the central space where I will be recording the progress of both my ongoing and completed projects. Call it a project journal if you will. I&amp;rsquo;ll stick with Blog for now because calling it a &amp;ldquo;Project log&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Plog&amp;rdquo; won&amp;rsquo;t be worth the extra explanation.
Why have a project log at all? As has already been explained in detail by a good friend - recording a project serves as a great way to round off a project and know when it is actually done.</description>
