      <description>I have a set of old very worse-for-wear speakers that my father built when he was in his early twenties. The last few decades have taken their toll. The cabinets have peeling chipboard, badly worn edges, and a front panel that is swinging free. As such, their Spouse Approval Factor was rock bottom. Nevertheless they still sounded pretty good.
I finally decided to open them up, remove the drivers, and build new cabinets for them if I found that they were worth saving.</description>
