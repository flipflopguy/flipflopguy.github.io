      <description>I have a set of old very worse-for-wear speakers from when my dad was my age. They are quite old, the cabinets have peeling chipboard, and one of the front panels was falling off. Their Spouse Approval Factor was rock bottom. Nevertheless they still sounded pretty good.
I finally decided to open them up, remove the drivers and build new cabinets for them if they were worth saving.</description>
