<p>I have a set of old very worse-for-wear speakers from when my dad was my age. They are quite old, the cabinets have peeling chipboard, and one of the front panels was falling off. 
Their Spouse Approval Factor was rock bottom. Nevertheless they still sounded pretty good.</p>
<p>I finally decided to open them up, remove the drivers and build new cabinets for them if they were worth saving.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/speaker-build/woofer_back.jpg"
         alt="Goodmans AXIOM 401" width="400"/> <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>They are definitely worth saving. The main drivers had been replaced with 12in Goodman Axiom 401s. These drivers are famous for producing lovely warm sound and lots of it. 
They are highly sought after, with two sets of very similar Axiom 301s going for over R15000 on ebay.</p>
<p>The frequency response for the Axiom 401s is given as 30Hz to 12kHz so I decided to add tweeters to fill in the top end. 
I was able to source these Goodman compression horn tweeters which should complement the drivers nicely. Their frequency response is 2.5kHz to 35kHz. I&rsquo;m pretty sure my hearing stops somewhere south of 30kHz so they should be more than adequate.</p>

<h2 id="tweeter-crossover-bypass-mod">Tweeter crossover bypass mod</h2>
<p>The crossover that I salvaged from the old cabinets is designed has a selectable crossover point. Either 2.5kHz or 3.5kHz. Given the abilities of the drivers both of these are a little low but for now I set it to 3.5kHz. I may replace it in the future.
Fun fact. This is a series crossover and is wired differently from the parallel equivalent. Most notably, the tweeter and the woofer share a terminal.</p>
<p>The tweeter has a built in crossover which will not play nicely with the crossover unit I was planning to use. I&rsquo;m no expert, but I suspect that having the extra high pass filter on the tweeter result in a diminished frequency response for the frequencies between the crossover frequency and the high pass filter frequency on the tweeter.
When in doubt, simulate.</p>
<p>I did a quick and dirty simulation with LT spice using a second order Butterworth to represent the crossover box and a simple cap for the simple cap on the tweeter.</p>
<figure>

         alt="Crossover combo" width="400"/> <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With the series crossovers there is a nasty spike in the frequency response at 3kHz followed by an even nastier null from 4kHz to 11kHz. Left uncorrected a large portion of whatever you happen to be listening to would simple disappear.</p>
<figure>

         alt="Modded crossover" width="400"/> <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To avoid this I bypassed the filter on the tweeter, leaving the capacitor in place. As the simulation shows, this will vastly improve things. I had to make several assumptions and I don&rsquo;t know if the crossover accounts for the increased impedance of the tweeter but I will tweak things at a later stage if necessary.</p>
<p>I then removed the crossover on the tweeter by simply bypassing it with a wire. Done.

         alt="After tweeter mod" width="400"/> <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>This will allow me to easily return them to stock if I decide to go a different route with the crossover. As mentioned, the crossover point is actually pretty low for this driver and tweeter combination so I may in future remove the bypass on the tweeter and add a low pass filter on the woofer.</p>
<h2 id="cabinet">Cabinet</h2>
<p>I was able to find recommended cabinet dimensions in an old Japanese datasheet. Many thanks to Google for translating.</p>

<p>The smaller hole in the cabinet is, as far as I can tell, for Goodman&rsquo;s Acoustic Resonance Unit. The ARU is, in my understanding, a partially stuffed port without a tube. I decided to rather go with a a standard port tuned to 40Hz.
During the build I decided to rather tune it as deep as it would go and then adjust it as necessary.</p>

<p>Tennis ball for scale. The messy white paint is just primer to prevent the inside of the cabinet from absorbing moisture.</p>

<p>The tweeters fitted in very snugly.</p>

<p>The crossover was attached to the side of the cabinet before the batting was pressed into the back of the cabinet.</p>

<p>The woofer was bolted to the the face plate before the face plate was screwed into the cabinet itself. Rather nerve racking working with a screwdriver so close to the cone.</p>

<p>I was really relieved when the drivers were safely installed in the face plate and everything was safely closed up.</p>

<h2 id="finishing-off">Finishing off</h2>
<p>Once the drivers were installed and had been been given a good listen, I reluctantly unplugged them to make a few cosmetic changes. These things sound GOOD!</p>
<p>My first priority was to protect the drivers from our cat and unwitting fingers. To this end I bought a set of cheap grills and classed them up by stretching sections cut from a pair of stockings over them. 
This did hide the cones but would protect them and also give the face a uniform black appearance and vastly improve the Spouse Approval Factor. I also added a pair of plastic port flares and stretched some of the last bits of stocking over the back to hide the green batting. 
I don&rsquo;t know what this will do to the sound quality but given that I plan to tune the ports further I decided to go ahead as an experiment.</p>

<p>Finally I added proper terminals to the back as well as a carry handle - these things are heavy.</p>

<h2 id="listening-impressions">Listening impressions</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m keen to hear the opinion of some folk with more an ear but to me these sound epic. Good, punchy bass that isn&rsquo;t overpowering. Detailed but not bright. That trademark warm Goodman&rsquo;s sound with no shrillness. I listen to music while I work and often have to give my ears a break after a while. 
I don&rsquo;t get that with these.</p>
<p>In the immortal words of DJ Snake:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn down for what!?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="future-improvements-and-tweaks">Future improvements and tweaks.</h2>
<p>In the future I plan to properly tune the port. At the moment it&rsquo;s tuned way too low, probably somewhere around 20 - 30 Hz. Adjusting that could extend the bass response a little lower. I&rsquo;ve noticed on a very few songs with very low frequencies an odd rumble.</p>
<p>Once that&rsquo;s done I&rsquo;ll probably custom design a crossover for the driver and tweeter as well as a transform to better balance the volume of the woofer and tweeter. At the moment I can&rsquo;t hear much, if anything, from the tweeter.</p>
